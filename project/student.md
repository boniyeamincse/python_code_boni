## Problem Statement

Write a Python program to manage student results.  
The program should:

1. Take the student's name and roll number as input.
2. Take marks for three subjects as input.
3. Calculate the average marks.
4. Determine if the student has passed or failed.  
   - A student fails if they score less than 33 in any subject.
5. Assign a grade based on the average marks:
   - F: Fail (if failed in any subject)
   - E: 33–49
   - D: 50–59
   - C: 60–69
   - B: 70–79
   - A: 80–89
   - A+: 90 and above
6. Display the student's information, marks, average, pass/fail status, and grade.
